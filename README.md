### The Hero Image Section
+ The hero image shows the beauty salon interior, using a photo. It helps potential clients to understand what to expect when they decide to visit the salon.
+ The image also contains welcoming words which can make potential clients to feel welcomed.
+ The heading with the welcoming words was designed to partly cover the salon interior image with the goal to prevent users from focusing on less important details on the image rather than on the website's content which calls them to action.

## Testing

+ I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari.
+ I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using Chrome devtools device toolbar.
+ I confirmed that the navigation, gallery, offer, contact information, and service page text are all readable and easy to understand.
+ I confirmed that the booking form functions properly on a range of devices. It requires entries in every field, accepts only an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

## Bugs

#### Solved bugs

+ When I typed a name in the form input field, it was not shown. 
+ I realized that it was because of my mistake in a css rule. Both the color of the input field and of the text were set to white. 
+ As soons as I changed the color of the text to more contrasting dark color, the issue was solved.
